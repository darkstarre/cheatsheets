====================Integers===========================
###Integers are whole numbers
# + Adds two numbers together
1 + 2 #=> 3

# - subtracts one number from a different one
3 - 2 #=> 1

# < boolean value returned to see if number on left is less than number on right
2 < 4 #=> true

# > boolean value returned to see if number on left is greater than number on right
2 > 4 #=> false

# == assigns a number, or checks an exact number for a boolean
two == 2, or if two == true

# <= boolean value assigned if int on left is less than or equal to int on right
2 <= 2

# >= boolean value assigned if int on left is greater than or equal to int on right
4 >= 2

# .to_f changes int to float
2.to_f => 2.0
